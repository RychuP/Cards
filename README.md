# Cards

Card games based on the [XNA Game Studio](https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio) sample ported by [RB Whitaker](https://github.com/rbwhitaker/MonoGameSamples) to Monogame.

The project has been heavily modified to my liking. I am working on adding a poker game based on the common framework.
